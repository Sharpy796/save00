# Sharpy796's Noita `save00` folder.
My laptop crashed recently, and it somehow resulted in my entire save file being wiped. Creating a Github repository to make future backups of it was mentioned, so I have decided to do so. I have included the entire save folder so you can see everything that goes on inside of it.
